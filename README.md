# Twitter-Challenge

## Introduction
In this challenge, I have created a Python script to perform sentiment analysis of the social media activities of 5 major news sources (BBC, CBS, CNN, Fox, and New York times), and visualized the insights.

Using the Tweepy API on Python, I have pulled 100 most recent tweets from each of the five media's official Twitter account.
